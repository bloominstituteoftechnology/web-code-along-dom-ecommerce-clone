# web-code-along-dom-ecommerce-clone

## Setup
1. Clone the project
2. cd into the directory
3. Run `open index.html.` **Optional**: download the Live Server extension on VS Code and use that instead for hot loading.

Since there aren't any external dependencies (for now...) there is no installation process. 

Tested on Node v 16.14.0->LTS.
