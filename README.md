# Code-Along 2.2 - Prototypes and Classes - Solution

## Make sure you DID NOT FORK -- You will not have access to all of the code required for each Code-Along! If you forked, simply delete this clone and re-clone from the BloomTech URL.

## Navigation Between App Versions
- Starter and Solution code are always available to learners for every Code-Along. You should always attempt to start with the starter code before looking up the answers; they are available to help if you are unable to resolve the solution yourself. Navigate through different Code-Along lessons through the Git branching structure. The following lessons are available on the following branches:
    - [2.2-Prototypes-and-Classes-starter](https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/web-code-along-dom-ecommerce-clone/tree/2.2-Prototypes-and-Classes-starter)
    - [2.2-Prototypes-and-Classes-solution](https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/web-code-along-dom-ecommerce-clone/tree/2.2-Prototypes-and-Classes-solution)
