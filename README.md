# Code-Along Project - DOM eCommerce Clone - Information and Setup

## Setup
1. Clone the project
2. cd into the directory
3. Run `open index.html.` **Optional**: download the Live Server extension on VS Code and use that instead for hot loading.

Since there aren't any external dependencies (for now...) there is no installation process. 

Tested on Node v 16.14.0->LTS.

## Navigation Between App Versions
- Starter and Solution code are always available to learners for every Code-Along. You should always attempt to start with the starter code before looking up the answers; they are available to help if you are unable to resolve the solution yourself. Navigate through different Code-Along lessons through the Git branching structure. The following lessons are available on the following branches:
    - [2.2-Prototypes-and-Classes-starter](https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/web-code-along-dom-ecommerce-clone/tree/2.2-Prototypes-and-Classes-starter)
    - [2.2-Prototypes-and-Classes-solution](https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/web-code-along-dom-ecommerce-clone/tree/2.2-Prototypes-and-Classes-solution)
